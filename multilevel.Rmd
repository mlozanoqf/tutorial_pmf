# Data visualization and multilevel modeling.


## Data visualization.

The objective of this example is to show the power of data visualization to understand the data better, and introduce the concept of multilevel regression given the \texttt{hsb} database.

```{r}
# Load the relevant \texttt{R} packages.
library(lme4) # Linear Mixed-Effects Models.
library(lmerTest) # Tests in Linear Mixed Effects Models.
library(tidyverse) # Collection of packages.
library(merTools) # The database used in RISIS course is here.
library(sjPlot) # Plot lmer and glmer mods
library(MuMIn)
library(knitr) # To show formatted tables (kable).
library(ggplot2)
```

The following is the description of the data taken from the \texttt{merTools} R package.

This is a subset of data from the 1982 High School and Beyond survey used as examples for Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) software. The data file used for this presentation is a subsample from the 1982 High School and Beyond Survey and is used extensively in Hierarchical Linear Models by Raudenbush and Bryk, see for example @raudenbush2002hierarchical. The \texttt{hsb} database consists of 8 variables, and 7,185 students nested in 160 schools.

-   \texttt{schid}. A numeric vector, 160 unique values.
-   \texttt{mathach}. A numeric vector for the performance on a standardized math assessment.
-   \texttt{female}. A numeric vector coded 0 for male and 1 for female.
-   \texttt{ses}. A numeric measure of student socio-economic status.
-   \texttt{minority}. A numeric vector coded 0 for white and 1 for non-white students.
-   \texttt{schtype}. A numeric vector coded 0 for public and 1 for private schools.
-   \texttt{meanses}. A numeric, the average SES for each school in the data set.
-   \texttt{size}. A numeric for the number of students in the school.


Let's see the data.

```{r}
# Let's take a look of the data and its original structure.
data(hsb) # Load the database.
head(hsb) # Look at the first values for inspection.
```

```{r}
# Now, let's inspect the data structure.
str(hsb) # See the original data structure.
```

This structure might not be completely appropriate as factors are not clearly  defined. Let's change that.

```{r}
# From numerical to factors. This is useful for further analysis.
hsb$schid <- as.factor(hsb$schid)
hsb$minority <- as.factor(hsb$minority)
hsb$female <- as.factor(hsb$female)
hsb$schtype <- as.factor(hsb$schtype)
str(hsb) # See the new structure.
```

There is a weak, positive and linear relationship between the performance on a standardized math assessment and the socio-economic status of students. This is supported by a very basic and preliminar data analysis taking all information available, without any filter or data subset.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(x = ses, y = mathach)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "The big picture.", 
       subtitle = "The higher the socio-economic status, the higher the 
       math archievment.")
```

We propose that the student socio-economic status and the school characteristics matters in the performance of the math assessment. We have 160 schools, let's see only a sample of 10 and see how the original linear relationship changes.

```{r}
set.seed(13)
s = sample(hsb$schid, 10)
ggplot(hsb[hsb$schid == s, ], aes(x = ses, y = mathach, group = schid,
                                  color = schid)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F) +
  labs(title = "School and student socio-economic status matters.", 
       subtitle = "A sample of 10 randomly selected schools.")
```

Now, the previous general trend is less clear as we see what happen in 10 randomly selected schools. In some schools the relationship is positive and in others negative. This suggest that the relationship between socio-economic status of students and the math achievement depends (at least) on the school characteristics.

The performance on a standardized math assessment can be driven by the interaction of different factors. Here, we see the differences between male and female students. According to this, males perform better than female students.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(mathach, fill = female)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 3) +
  labs(title = "Males versus females", 
       subtitle = "Males perform better than females in math assessments.")
```

The data analysis reveals a gender issue here. Then, the math achievement seems to be a multi-factor issue that depends on the school characteristics and the student gender. We can go one step back to reveal the role of gender in our original scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(x = ses, y = mathach, 
                color = female)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Males versus females by socio-economic status.", 
  subtitle = "Males perform better than females in math, and this
  difference slightly reduces as socio-economic status improves.")
```

This gender difference remains more or less constant across different socio-economic status. One may argue that this gap reduces as socio-economic status improves, but this reduction is minor, and the gender gap remains.

One school characteristic is whether it is private or public. Here, we illustrate that private schools students show a better performance on the standardized math assessments.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(mathach, fill = schtype)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 3) +
  labs(title = "Public versus private schools", 
       subtitle = "Private school students perform better than those 
       in public schools at math assessments.")
```

Although better math performance is achieved in private schools, the socio-economic status of the student could compensate in a way this effect. Let's verify this thought.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(x = ses, y = mathach, 
                color = schtype)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Public versus private schools by socio-econonomic status", 
       subtitle = "The gap between public and private schools reduces as the
       socio-economic status of students improves.")
```

According to this plot, socio-economic status play an important role at making these school differences indistinguishable. Students at private and public schools do equally well as long as they belong to a high socio-economic status. The plot also reveals that differences in math achievement are greater as the socio-economic status decrease.

Let's see what happens with minorities. Apparently, white students show a better performance on the standardized math assessments.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(mathach, fill = minority)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 3) +
  labs(title = "White versus non-white students", 
       subtitle = "White students perform better than non-white at math.")
```

Now, following the logic of our previous data analysis, we show the role of the socio-economic status in this minority gap.

```{r}
ggplot(hsb, aes(x = ses, y = mathach, 
                color = minority)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "White versus non-white students.", 
  subtitle = "The gap tend to increase as socio-economic status improves.")
```

Minority differences increases as socio-economic status of the students improves. In other words, here the socio-economic status increases the gap between these two groups.

## Multilevel modeling - estimation.

We can learn a lot by visualizing the data. However, we can learn even more by implementing an econometric technique to help us understand the determinants of the math achievement.

*Two level multilevel regression. Null model: m1a.*

```{r}
# We start with the null model m1a.
m1a <- lmer(mathach ~ (1 | schid), data = hsb, REML = FALSE)
summary(m1a)
#plot(m1a, type=c("p","smooth"), col.line = 1)
m1a_AIC <- extractAIC(m1a)[2]
ans <- data.frame(m1a_AIC)
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)
```

*Two level multilevel regression. Second model: m2.*

```{r}
# Now, the model m2.
m2 <- lmer(mathach ~ ses + female + (1 | schid), data = hsb)
summary(m2)
# paste0("AIC = ",extractAIC(m2)[2])
m2_AIC <- extractAIC(m2)[2]
ans <- data.frame(m1a_AIC, m2_AIC)
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)

```

*Two level multilevel regression. Third model: m3.*

```{r}
# Now, the model called m3 in the course material.

m3 <- lmer(mathach ~ ses + female + size + meanses + schtype +
                 (1 | schid), data = hsb)
summary(m3)
#paste0("AIC = ",extractAIC(m3)[2])

m3_AIC <- extractAIC(m3)[2]
ans <- data.frame(m1a_AIC, m2_AIC, m3_AIC)
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)
```

*Two level multilevel regression. Optimize the model.*

```{r}
# We can propose an optimization of the model in terms of the AIC criterion.
options(na.action = "na.fail")
m_opt <- lmer(mathach ~ minority * female * ses  * schtype + 
                      (1 | schid), data = hsb, REML = FALSE)
mm <- dredge(m_opt)
head(model.sel(mm, rank = AIC))
```

*Two level multilevel regression. A good parsimonious model.*

```{r}
m_AIC <- lmer(mathach ~ minority + ses + minority*ses + 
                      (1 | schid), data = hsb, REML = FALSE)
summary(m_AIC)
#paste0("AIC = ",extractAIC(m_AIC)[2])

mpars_AIC <- extractAIC(m_AIC)[2]
ans <- data.frame(m1a_AIC, m2_AIC, m3_AIC, mpars_AIC)
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)

```

*Two level multilevel regression. A good not so parsimonious model.*

```{r}
m_AIC2 <- lmer(mathach ~  female + minority + schtype + 
                 ses + female*ses + minority*schtype + minority*ses +
                 schtype*ses +
                      (1 | schid), data = hsb, REML = FALSE)
summary(m_AIC2)
#paste0("AIC = ",extractAIC(m_AIC2)[2])

mnopars_AIC <- extractAIC(m_AIC2)[2]
ans <- data.frame(m1a_AIC, m2_AIC, m3_AIC, mpars_AIC, mnopars_AIC)
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)

```

## Multilevel modeling - final remark.

Conclusion. Data visualization help us to better understand the data relationships. These last two models have a low AIC compared with the models shown in the course.

```{r}
kable(t(ans), caption = "Model's AIC.", digits = 2)
```
